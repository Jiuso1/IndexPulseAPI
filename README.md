# What's this?

This project is an API used by [IndexPulse website](https://github.com/Jiuso1/IndexPulse), where you can register, log in, and index URLs in Google.

# How does this work?

[IndexPulse service](https://github.com/Jiuso1/IndexPulse), in collaboration with [IndexPulseAPI service](https://github.com/Jiuso1/IndexPulseAPI) and [gis](https://github.com/goenning/google-indexing-script) is able to index URLs. This can be done by uploading the appropriate JSON that gis documentation explains.

# Sad story about this project

I coded this project with the highest quality I could deliver, but the person who "hired me" via Upwork changed his mind and suddenly didn't want to pay me anything (an absolutely ridiculous amount for all the work done). Due to that, I reported him, and I hope that this now open-source project will help people!
